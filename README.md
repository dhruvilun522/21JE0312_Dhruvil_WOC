# ML Bootcamp
This is a Machine Learning library consisting of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, K-Means Clustering and Neural Network.
## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).
Dataset used is Linear_train for training and Linear_test for testing.
## Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
Dataset used is Polynomial_train for training and Polynomial_test for testing.
## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.
Dataset used is emnist-letters-train for training and emnist-letters-test for testing.
## KNN
In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric supervised learning method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set.
Dataset used is emnist-letters-train for training and emnist-letters-test for testing.
## K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
Dataset used is emnist-letters-train and emnist-letters-test
## Neural Network
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Dataset used is emnist-letters-train for training and emnist-letters-test for testing.
